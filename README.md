Coursework description: 

A nationwide retailing corporation (such as Homebase http://www.homebase.co.uk/ or B&Q http://www.diy.com/) is planning to develop a new distributed store management system for their retail branches to provide better coordination of their business.  It has named the proposed system DE-Store. 

Your company want to pitch for the software development contract and plan to do this by developing a software prototype of an architecture that you believe would show that you could meet the needs of the project.

DE-Store is NOT an online shopping system; instead it is a DISTRIBUTED business management system. Please note that DE-Store is a DISTRIBUTED system. You are supposed to use the appropriate architecture styles and technologies you’ve learnt to develop an effective solution, such as client/server, peer to peer, service-oriented, RMI, three-tiered, etc. DE-Store is expected to be an expandable and adaptive system to accommodate changing business requirements in the future. 

DE-Store aims to have a suite of store management functionalities such as price control, inventory control, delivery charge, approval of financial support, and performance analysis. 

•	Price Control: DE-Store allows the store manager to set the price of the products and to select products on a variety of sale offers, which include 3 for 2, buy one get one free, free delivery charges.
•	Inventory Control: stock is monitored all the time by uploading data from the warehouse database. Items out of stock will be ordered from the central inventory system at the headquarters. DE-Store generates warning messages for items in low stock automatically and also sends them to the mobile message box or email box of the store manager. 
•	Loyalty Card: the store can make further special offers to customers who regularly use their branches.
•	Finance Approval: DE-Store offers its customer the opportunity to buy now and pay later using an online finance system, Enabling, which is linked to DE-Store via a portal. 
•	Reports and Analysis: DE-Store tracks the purchase activities of customers from the accounting database and generates reports on how the store is performing.

DE-store is expected to be an expandable and adaptive system to accommodate changing business requirements in the future. 


You should make a pitch to win this contract as follows: 

1.	Make a recommendation for two architectures that could be adopted, explaining the components and connectors and the protocol for information exchange. 

2.	Select one of the two candidate architectures and justify your choice in terms of the quality attributes you would expect it to possess.

3.	Design and develop a prototype which will demonstrate the principles of the system. For example, you could establish an outline system with prototype components and connectors. This would then be used to demonstrate your competence when you pitch for the contract.

4.	Evaluate your system. Try to reassure the company that the completed version will exhibit the quality attributes you identified in 2.
